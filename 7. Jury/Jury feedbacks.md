# Jury feedbacks

## 18.01.2024

After presenting my project to the jury, they gave me some feedbacks which are the following:

- Remove the family, there should be only us, the player/main character

- The game should be set in one room only, not a big house

- We sould be the cause of our problems

- Snowball effect => Everything go worse and worse as we are trying to fix the situation

- Limit the number of objets

- They asked questions about how I'm gonna do the interactions in Unity

From this discussion, I think I need to simplify my project. It's not a big deal for me if I don't speak about mental load since the chore idea of my project was "dealing with the unexpected/finding unexpected solutions".
I am going to rethink the story to lower the amount of work I need to do while still keeping the story intertaining.

I'm adding this here since it happened just after the jury. I spent the week-end to a friend's apartment. Since it was a flat rented for students, it was really small with a living room/bedroom/kitchen and a bathroom (so only "2" rooms). Everything was organised in a 20 m2 surface. I thought this apartment could be the main inspiration for the new setting of my story. Our character could be renting the place for the holidays to a student going back to their family for some time, leaving their cat here with us (yes, I still want a cat in the story... for now).
