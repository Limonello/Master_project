# Relationships and Mr. Bean

## 14.09.2024

I thought about the more serious/complex thematics my project could talk about. Obviously, my project tells in the first place the story of somenone going on holydays to someone's else place. Therefore, the game could talk about the relations between the public and the private sphere.
But then, I wondered if maybe it could also be interesting to be a bit more metaphorical and talk about an actual relationship. Our character could be someone starting a new relathionship (romantic/platonic like a friendship/else) with the person owning the house. What we do in the house can symbolize how the relationship is going. Breaking things and trying to fix them can look funny from the outside but it can become quite sad/bittersweet if we see it as a relationship between too people.

I think it could be a good thing having in my project a first layer of interpretation that is just full of sillyness and goofiness and then we understand the second and more serious layer. I really love stories playing with two different tones, for me, the contrast between them can add more depth to a project's message.

Ho, and I rediscovered that one sketch from Mr. Bean that captures perfectly the kind of interactions I want to create in my game:
