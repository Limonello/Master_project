I bought two games recommended by my tutor: [Unpacking](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1135690/Unpacking/) and [Les Chevaliers de Baphomet (a remake from the original version)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/580430/Broken_Sword_1_Original_Version/?l=french).
For the second one, installing it was a bit tricky since my computer is a mac and the game is no longer compatible with it. But since I have a Wacom Cintiq running on Windows 10, I decided to install Steam to run the game on it. It took me some time to install everything. Then, I tried launching the game but it failed. After multiple attempts, I downloaded the original version of the game that was available as a DLC once you have bought the Director's Cut version. After this, I was finally able to launch the game... to again have problems, this time with the mouse not moving (probably because I was using the Wacom's pen). To this point, I gave up and decided to give it another try another day.
