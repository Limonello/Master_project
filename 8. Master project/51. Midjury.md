Daniel and FÃ©licien gave me different feedbacks about my project:

- They suggested I ask people to test my structure to see if the game gives enough informations to understand the goal/how it works
- They suggested to add a little bit more context through text at the beginning of the demo.
- Daniel liked my Github.
- For the final presentation, I should contextualise my game in the video game field in general.
- They talked a bit about the aesthetic of my menu but they both had different opinions about it.
