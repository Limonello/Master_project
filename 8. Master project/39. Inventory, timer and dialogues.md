# Inventory, timer and dialogues

## 23-28.04.2024.md

On Tuesday, I talked with Pierre about dialogue systems and co-routines. This last one might useful to structure some elements of my game. He also told me about state machines, player prefs and visual scripting (which I used last year for a VR project).

I listed a few tutorials that might be useful later:

- Scene transitions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CE9VOZivb3I

- Cutscenes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms10GAMAydA

I kept working on a dialogue system, I didn't know if this was the best way of doing it. Pierre suggested I ask Douglas about it.

On Wednesday, I a made a prefab for the doors in my game. I also asked Douglas about the dialogues systems. He told me about [Yarn Spinner](https://www.yarnspinner.dev) and [Ink (Inkle)](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/). I think I will try Ink first but I want to ask St√©phanie her opinion about it. For the end of the day, I added a timer and made a prefab out of it.

I worked on an inventory for the rest of the week in a new Unity project. I followed [this serie of tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wKB_rxtqh4&list=PLSR2vNOypvs6eIxvTu-rYjw2Eyw57nZrU&index=1) and adapt it for the needs of my game. I have a simple and basic inventory system but I still need to add a few more things:

- How to empty the inventory
- How to save the inventory's data when we change scene
- How to use the inventory's data to activate sprites in the repairs phase
- Optional: don't destroy objects when the inventory is full

Change scene when 4 objects are collected:

I made a first attempt to change the cursor's image. I was able to change its basic appearance but I need to figure out how to make it change when going over a collider and when clicking.
