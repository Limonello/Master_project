# Focusing on visuals

## 10.05.10

I started drawing the backgrounds. For the next few days, I want to focus only on the visuals.

For the menu screen, I took an overall view of a town in the game Deltarune as reference. Since we can chose different locations, I wanted to have the visual of a small map even if the distances are not real.
