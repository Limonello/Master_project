# Scenpgraphy

## 29.04.2024

We had our first scenography class. I don't need a lot of material to present my project since it is gonna be playable on a computer.

On the same day, I added a Pan Camera to one of my scenes. But I hesitate to keep this function. I fear that people might not understand it is present and that they might be frustrated. Also, the grandma's appartment is rather small and a Pan Camera might alterate this perception.

I also added a scene for "Save/Quit" options when we want to leave in the middle of the game (I don't know if it will be functiunal in the end but I still need to add a button in the UI).

I kept documenting myself about DontDestroyOnLoad and Singletones but I struggle to find the good way of doing things for the needs of my game.

I watched these tutorials:

[Saving Data Between Scenes (Without Duplicating Objects)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzdADY2LkJU&list=PLSR2vNOypvs6eIxvTu-rYjw2Eyw57nZrU&index=12)
