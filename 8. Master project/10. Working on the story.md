# Working on the story

## 27.02.2024

I spent the day thinking and writing about the different stories and characters inside my game. This may change over time but at least I have a first draft to work on.

For now, I think the full game will contain between 8 and 10 different places with a character for each of them. For each place it will also be possible to come back to it to complete 2 to 3 "levels" (for a total of 16 minim. to 30 levels max.).

This will allow us to learn gradually about our character through the different places and "levels" without actually seing them.
