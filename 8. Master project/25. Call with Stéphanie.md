I had a call with Stéphanie. We talked about what needed to be decided at this point of the project and she gave me a few different references:

[The book "Game Feel" by Steve Swink](http://www.game-feel.com)

And the following games: [GNOG](https://www.gnoggame.com), [The Room](https://store.steampowered.com/app/288160/The_Room/?l=french), [Zagad](https://nekromana.itch.io/zagad) and [Jalopy](https://store.steampowered.com/app/446020/Jalopy/)
