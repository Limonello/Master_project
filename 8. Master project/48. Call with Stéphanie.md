# Call with Stéphanie

## 16.05.2024

I had a call with Stéphanie. We talked about the pictures'quality (PPU and else) and the builds'resolutions (Full HD vs 4K). For now, I need to focus on the audiovisual feedbacks in repairs phases. I also need to work on the cursor and dialogues. Stéphanie asked me to do a list of what I want/need to do in order to plan the remaining time.

After the call, I documented myself about resolutions in Unity [through this article.](https://blog.unity.com/engine-platform/choosing-the-resolution-of-your-2d-art-assets) I also saw how to change a build's screen size when exporting.
