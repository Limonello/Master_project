# First ideas and prototypes

## 04.12.2023

After some researches, I decided to focus on the concept of "unexpected" in video games. I want to explorer it through a cooking game or domestic simulator in which you have to fullfill tasks with unexpected tools.

First paper prototype. I cutted some shapes (vegetables, knife, ...) to test if it could make good interactions for TEST DAY. I think this kind of prototype could help to see how people use an object in different ways depending of the context.
